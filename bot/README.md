Welcome to this repository. Here you can view and download the bot code for the Telegram for your needs. The bot needs a token, which you can get in the Telegram, and your own database, which you must create yourself. It requires a PythonTelegramBotAPI library, which can be installed using the pip-requirements.txt.
